## Duck Hunt

`first.go` 

A duck that talks.

`second.go`

Testing if it's a duck based on what it says.

`third.go`

Add a [laughing dog](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g1QCbXCezNc).

`fourth.go`

A Talker interface.

`fifth.go`

ClayPigeon does not implement Talker.

`sixth.go`

Type assertions, and [calling things the interface doesn't specify](http://how-bazaar.blogspot.co.nz/2013/07/stunned-by-go.html).

`stack.go`

Empty interfaces satisfied by any type.

`stack2.go`

What happens when we put a duck on the stack? Type switches.
